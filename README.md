[Fábio Ribeiro](https://github.com/fcmribeiro22)

Hello! I'm Fábio, a former dynamic salesman who has transitioned into the realm of data analytics. With the recent acquisition of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have redirected my focus from product sales to the communication of insights extracted from intricate datasets.

My prior engagement with web development led me to an not-so-unexpected affinity for data analytics. I am now delighted to present a portfolio of data analysis projects that highlight my adeptness in extracting valuable insights, solving intricate problems, and utilizing data to facilitate informed decision-making.

My inclination towards data analytics is rooted in my longstanding analytical disposition. A predilection for informed decisions based on statistical advantage, as well as a penchant for relying on facts rather than conjecture to address queries, further underpin my affinity for this field.
